Philosopher AI is a web application that presents users with thought-provoking ethical or world dilemmas and invites them to share their personal views. Once a user submits their response, the app uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo model to analyze the response and compare it with the perspectives of major historical philosophers — such as Socrates, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, and John Stuart Mill.

The AI evaluates which philosophers would likely agree or disagree with the user’s viewpoint and assigns each a score from 0 to 100, reflecting alignment. This creates a fun and educational experience that helps users reflect on their moral reasoning through the lens of classical philosophy.
